# Restaurants Data Analysis
In this report, we will review data that is collected from various restaurants, which includes different restaurants’ policies and ratings, in order to find effective patterns for restaurants and gain profitable insights on all the discussed issues.
Data and Methodology
The given data named ‘restaurant Database.sql’ includes the following tables:
* consumer preferences
* consumers
* data dictionary
* ratings
* restaurant cuisines
* restaurants

The aim of the analysis is to bring insights about policies that could maximize the rating of the restaurant.
The main rating criteria in this work is ‘overall rating’ because it sums the overall satisfaction, and always has a high correlation with any other score.
(Apart from the alcohol issue where we also addressed the price and service rating in addition to the overall rating,
And we did an average of all three).


In particular, we have examined the policies regarding the following issues and asked some related questions:

* The price of the restaurant and its food How does the price affect its rating? Which type of restaurant is preferred by the different kinds of consumers? 
* The available parking for the consumers How does the parking options affect its rating? Is there any difference between car owners and non car owners? 
* The smoking policy of the restaurant How does the available smoking area affect its rating? Is there any difference between smokers and non-smokers?

* The alcohol availability in the restaurant How does the alcohol service affect the rating?
Is there a different trend for consumers with different drink-levels? 

In the four issues we present the data, visualize and discuss it from different perspectives and phrase a concluding suggestion that the restaurant is advised to take in order to optimize its rating.
